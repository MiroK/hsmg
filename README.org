* Installation of Hs multigrid
  Execute `source setup.rc` to have hsmg module available in this shell.
  FEniCS stack (which include numpy, scipy) is currently the only dependency.
  Running demos and tests require fenics_ii. For different MinRes implementations
  the cbc.block has to be installed from [[https://github.com/MiroK/cbc.block][github]] (until the features 
  are merged to cbc.block@bitbucket)

** Citing
  If you used hsmg in your research please consider citing our par on fractional [[https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/18M1191488]][multigrid]

** Tests
   Execute `pytest` in the current directory.

** TODO
   Immediate:
   - debugging

   Future:
   - coarsening of line meshes which are not straight

** FIXME
   0. Throughout the code there is a silent assumption of only running
      in serial. I don't prioritize running in parallel.
