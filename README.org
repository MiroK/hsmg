* Installation of Hs multigrid
  Execute `source setup.rc` to have hsmg module available in this shell.
  FEniCS stack (which include numpy, scipy) is currently the only dependency.
  Running demos requires fenics_ii.

** Tests
   Execute `pytest` in the current directory.

** TODO
   Immediate:
   - restriction_matrix        [OK^1]
   - Dirichlet dofs            [OK^2]
   - macro_dofmap              [OK^3]
   - the rest of multigrid     []
     
   Future:
   - coarsening of line meshes which are not straight

** FIXME
   0. Throughout the code there is a silent assumption of only running
      in serial. I don't prioritize running in parallel.
