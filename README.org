* Installation of Hs multigrid
  Execute `source setup.rc` to have hsmg module available in this shell.
  FEniCS stack (which include numpy, scipy) is currently the only dependency.

** Tests
   Execute `pytest` in the current directory.

** TODO
   Immediate:
   - restriction_matrix
   - macro_dofmap
   - Dirichlet dofs
   - the rest of multigrid

   Future:
   - coarsening of line meshes which are not straight
